<!--This web application is based on a VGG-16 based Convolutional Neural Network, trained to recognise pneumonia on chest x-rays. The neural network achieved accuracy exceeding 93% on the relevant test set of more than 500 x-rays. Please note that the predictive accuracy of the model, depends on the quality and quantity of the training data. Therefore the model has limitations and cannot be used for definite clinical predictions! Instead it can be used for research and comparison purposes (please see notes below). -->
Pneumonia is a lung infection which causes the inflammation of the small air sacs i.e, Alveoli in one or both lungs. It impacts seven percent of the world’s population, contributing to 2 million children’s deaths per year out of which India contributes about 23% of the global pneumonia burden. The WHO estimates that pneumonia is responsible for one out of every three deaths in India. It is normally detected by a highly-trained consultant’s examination of a chest X-Ray radiograph which is a difficult task even for a professional radiologist. As a result, it is essential to create an automated method for detecting pneumonia to improve diagnosis accuracy. To address this, we developed a deep Transfer learning-based model using complex Visual Group Geometry VGG16 architecture to detect the presence of pneumonia. We analyzed our model with different optimizers to observe any changes in the results. From the result, we can conclude that our model can be used to diagnose pneumonia quickly with satisfactory performance accuracy.
